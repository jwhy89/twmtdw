						I have always enjoyed solving problems and exploring the world around me. My passion to learn has led me to pursue a higher education and a career in science, engineering, and technology. 
						<p>I am reinventing myself and seeking new opportunities in the career field of Information Technology. With my engineering background and diverse work experiences, e.g. solving system issues, fine tuning processes, and addressing user-related problems and concerns in the packaging industry, I can see these experiences and the knowledge gained from them crossing over and being applied to similar situations in IT related careers. This summer, I completed my Google IT Support Professional Certificate, a 5-course specialization by Google on Coursera. I am also enrolled in NextGenT's Network+ online course and am pursuing my CompTIA Network+ (N10-006) certification.</p>
