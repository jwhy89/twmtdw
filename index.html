						I have always enjoyed solving problems and exploring the world around me. 
						<br>My passion to learn has led me to pursue a higher education and a career in science, engineering, and technology. 
						<p>I am reinventing myself and seeking new opportunities in the career field of Information Technology. With my engineering background and diverse work experiences, e.g. solving system issues, fine tuning processes, and addressing user-related problems and concerns in the packaging industry, I can see these experiences and the knowledge gained from them crossing over and being applied to similar situations in IT related careers. This summer, I completed my Google IT Support Professional Certificate, a 5-course specialization by Google on Coursera. I am also enrolled in NextGenT's Network+ online course and am pursuing my CompTIA Network+ (N10-006) certification.</p>

						<div class"block-content">
								<p>I provide technical support and customer service for one of the largest technology and electronic consumer goods companies in the world, Apple. This is my first official introduction into the IT field but I have learned throughout my career how IT tools, services, and systems have become an indispensable resource in our lives. The extensive training from my work orientation and the knowledge gained from my Google IT Support training gave me the tools and depth of knowledge to better probe, analyze, isolate, and resolve my customersâ€™ issues. My positive attitude and calm demeanor also helps me to deal with difficult situations and various types of personalities in a fast-paced and ever-changing environment. Within 60 days of employment, I earned a $100 Amazon gift card for my great service and being a top advisor.

								<h4>Packaging Engineer Specialist</h4>
						</div>		
						<div class"block-content">
								<p>Being in this consulting role, I advise clients in packaging related issues. The most current client sought us out to work on their packaging specifications for inbound parts from their suppliers. We worked with their cross functional teams to review, recommend, and approve the specifications through a new approval process and new quality system. This project involved me and the team to also work closely with the suppliers and provide training to complete the specifications on a very aggressive schedule. We also dealt with conflicts between the proposed designs and the plant packaging requirements. Our investigation into these types of matters involved us being the liaison between the supplier, the plant stakeholders, and what we consider as best practices for packaging learned through experience and research.

								<h4>Packaging CAD Team - Quality Specialist</h4>
						</div>		
						<div class"block-content">
								<p>I worked collaboratively with Packaging R&D and packaging vendors to develop accurate drawings in ArtiosCAD and leveraged my knowledge in drafting to document company drawing standards and guidelines. During the last three months of my contract, I developed and implemented a training plan for the US and Mumbai India Team on packaging drawings and the drawing business processes because such materials did not exist. The training plan and associated documentation and video training will ensure efficient and effective onboarding and training of any new resource in this area and provide easy reference for those new to the role.  Also, I created and maintained packaging performance and drawing specifications in SAP prior to focusing specifically on drafting, documentation, and training.  In this role, I gained an understanding of the interdependence of R&D packaging development process with the Packaging Specification process.
